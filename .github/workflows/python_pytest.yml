# This workflow will run pytest.
#
# There are two job sets which run in parallel:
# 1. `pytest-fast`: Run fast tests only, and fail fast so the dev knows asap if they broke something.
# 2. `pytest`: Run all tests, across multiple Python versions.
#
# Note that `pytest-fast` also skips tests that require credentials, allowing it to run on forks.

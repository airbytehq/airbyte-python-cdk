# Developer Log

This directory contains logs and experiences from specific work in the repository. These logs are meant to share knowledge, document approaches, and provide insights for future developers working on similar tasks.

Each log should:

- Be named with a `YYYY-MM-description.md` format.
  - Continuations (including stacked PRs), can be named as `YYYY-MM-description-N.md`, with `N` beginning at the ordinal `2`.
- Include links to relevant PRs and resources.
- Document challenges, solutions, and learnings.
- Provide context that might be helpful for future work.
- Include a FAQ section for anticipated questions and answers about the iteration.
- Include a Closing & Next Steps section, where out-of-scope to-do items or follow-on investigations can be logged.

These logs are not meant to replace formal documentation but to supplement it with practical experiences and insights.

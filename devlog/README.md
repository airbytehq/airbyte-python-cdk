# Developer Log

This directory contains logs and experiences from specific work in the repository. These logs are meant to share knowledge, document approaches, and provide insights for future developers working on similar tasks.

Each log should:
- Be named with a `yyyy-mm-description.md` format
- Include links to relevant PRs and resources
- Document challenges, solutions, and learnings
- Provide context that might be helpful for future work

These logs are not meant to replace formal documentation but to supplement it with practical experiences and insights.
